<H3> 2. Baking with My Sisters </H3>

<p> On the 15th day of MCO, my sisters and I decided to make Egg Tart.  </p>
<p> This is the second time we made Egg Tart in this MCO's period. </p>
<p> Baking something means spending time with family because we made it together. </p>
<p> Its really fun baking with my sisters and i love it. </p>

<p> We were baking using this recipe. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YmpPXBOomy0"> Egg Tart Recipe </a> </p>
